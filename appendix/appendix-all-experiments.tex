\chapter{Complete List of Experiments}
\label{appendix-all-experiments}
I have also conducted many exploratory experiments. A complete list of the experiments are included below.
For the biological neural tensor, I conducted the following experiments:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item applying tensor CP decomposition to generate the neural manifold
    \item applying diffusion map to generate the neural manifold
    \item applying persistent homology and Wasserstein distance to compare the topological features of the neural manifold
    \item over training AlexNet
\end{enumerate}

For the artificial neural tensor, I conducted the following experiments:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item building the artificial neural tensor without considering shifts in images
    \item building the artificial neural tensor with shifts in images
    \item applying tensor CP decomposition on the artificial neural tensor (with shifts in images)
    \item studying how the neural manifold changes during the training of an ANN (instead of using the pre-trained ANN)
    \item applying persistent homology (though with limited explainability)
\end{enumerate}
