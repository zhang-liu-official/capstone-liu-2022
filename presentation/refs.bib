abstract = {This survey provides an overview of higher-order tensor decompositions, their applications,
and available software. A tensor is a multidimensional or $N$-way array. Decompositions
of higher-order tensors (i.e., $N$-way arrays with $N geq 3$) have applications in
psycho-metrics, chemometrics, signal processing, numerical linear algebra, computer
vision, numerical analysis, data mining, neuroscience, graph analysis, and elsewhere.
Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions
of the matrix singular value decomposition: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor
as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form
of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including
INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants
of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox, Tensor Toolbox, and Multilinear Engine are
examples of software packages for working with tensors.},
