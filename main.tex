    I would like to thank my supervisor Prof.~Francesca Spagnuolo  and co-supervisor and mentor Prof.~Steven W. Zucker and Dr.~Luciano Dyballa for their generous guidance and advice. They have made possible the many serendipitous moments in this project.  There have been ups and downs in this project, but their support has helped me keep a keen spirit for learning and discovery. 
    
    I am also grateful for my family and friends who have been patiently bearing with my endless sharing of my work and ideas.

\textbf{Key words: \keywordnames}

This work builds on a long line of research aiming to develop more accurate mathematical and computational models of the visual system. It has recently been shown that feed-forward neural networks turn out to be inaccurate models for the neurobiological networks in the visual cortex. We focused on a related question that has not been investigated: how is the structure of recurrent and transformer neural networks related to that of neurobiological networks (in the mouse visual cortex)?

We first build the biological and artificial neuron tensors using experimental neural spiking data and numerical simulations on recurrent and transformer neural networks. Using tensor component analysis, we discover which groups of neurons respond similarly to which stimuli input. Since these groups are likely not independent, we use the non-linear dimensionality reduction method, diffusion maps, to infer a manifold of neurons. This manifold structure implies a functional network (represented by the discrete data graph underlying the continuous manifold) and thus reflects both the neural circuit connections and the neuronâ€™s role in those circuits. Comparing the manifold structures of biological and artificial neural networks allows us to make precise inferences about similarities and differences in their respective functional circuits.

% \chapter{Claims}
%
% This paper presents the following original contributions:
%
% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item A hardware device for haptic sensory substitution along with designs for the construction of such a system.
% 	\item Two implementations of sensory substitution using haptic feedback, continuous and delayed feedback-based spatial navigation tasks, each of which include:
% 		\begin{enumerate}
% 			\item a front-end for providing visual input to the user during the training phase with useful readouts to the researcher,
% 			\item a transmission protocol, which maps information from the task at hand (spatial coordinates, velocity information, etc) to time-based sensor actuation signals (20$^{\circ}$ on servo 1, 35$^{\circ}$ on servo 2, etc) in real-time.
% 		\end{enumerate}
% 	\item An evaluation framework for measuring the performance of a sensory substitution system, which provides sample tasks that can be used to standardise and compare performance across the board for future research.
% 	\item A review of existing hardware and software stacks as well as possible avenues for development based on the developed metrics.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% In addition, code for displaying results in real-time, modules for managing servo overload, network latency and other factors were also written by the author.
