\section{Topological Data Analysis}
    
    Preliminary experiments to extract topological features from the neural spiking data: would it be interesting to use topological methods to infer useful information about the functional geometry? (see python notebook for some preliminary results on this)
    
    This paper \cite{chung_neural_2021} also provides a comprehensive review that includes both geometric methods and topological methods in determining the manifold structures of biological and artificial neural networks.
