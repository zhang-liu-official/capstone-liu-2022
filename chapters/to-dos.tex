lit review on neural manifolds

address all comments

Questions:
1. how is this a fair comparison if the input stimuli is different? visual flow versus natural images
Luciano mentioned in his talk but not sure... 

2. why comparing the manifold structure is enough for the comparison? 
connectivity

3. how can topology come in? it must be useful somewhere EPFL papers? 
one of the earliest applications of tda is in neural population response 


4. are the neuron modes essentially the same idea as neuron factors? (maybe the latter is specifically for linear dim red but the former is a more general notion)
