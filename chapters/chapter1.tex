\section{Dimensionality Reduction}
The main motivation behind dimensionality reduction: the intrinsic dimension of the data is usually much lower than the extrinsic dimension and the high-dimensionality is usually just an artifact of the representation. The representation of data has a potentially large degree of freedom, that is, the number of variables that are really necessary to describe the data is much smaller.
