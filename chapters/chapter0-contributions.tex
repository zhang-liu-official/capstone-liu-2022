\label{chapter-contributions} 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Experiments on neural data in the retina. 
    \item Extend an algorithm to investigate the manifold structure of pre-trained CNN and how it evolves over the course of training. 
    \item Develop a novel algorithm to investigate the manifold structure of pre-trained Vision Transformer.
    \item Develop a novel algorithm to investigate the manifold structure of convolutional recurrent neural network.
    \item Provide both qualitative and quantitative comparison for the manifold structure of CNN, RNN, and Vision Transformer, as well as with the neurobiological neural networks. 
    \item Produce original results that advance research in modeling the visual system.
    \item Produce original results that  advance research in understanding the internal representation of computer vision architectures.
